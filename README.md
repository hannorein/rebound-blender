Scripts to import REBOUND simulation data into BLENDER

## Installation
Blender comes with its own python environment. REBOUND and all other packages need to be installed for Blender's python environment, i.e. not the operating system wide python environment. Depending on where Blender is installed, you can install REBOUND using something similar to the following commands:

```
cd /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.90/python/bin
./python3.7m -m ensurepip
./python3.7m -m pip install rebound
```
